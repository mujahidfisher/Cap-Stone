                    I'm an avid anime enthusiast with a deep passion for the art form that has captivated me for many years. My journey into the<br> world of anime began a long time ago, and since then, I've immersed myself in countless anime series, films, and manga. One of<br> the highlights of my anime journey was attending Comic Con, an event that felt like a homecoming for fellow anime nerds like myself. <br>There, I had the opportunity to connect with like-minded fans. Which made me truly want to build this website.</p>
